# TestFit-Like Site Planner

This is a lightweight GIS-aware site planning tool designed to mimic the core functions of TestFit:

- Upload a parcel boundary (`.geojson`)
- Upload a slope-aware terrain (`.tif` DEM)
- View buildable areas and auto-generated unit layout
- Real-world accurate map overlay

Run with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
